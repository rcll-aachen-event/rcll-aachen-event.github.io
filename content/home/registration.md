## RCLL Aachen - 2022 Registration:

To register a team each team leader(s) collects details on the teams' participants (including themselves) and fills out this [registration form](https://forms.gle/irA5CjzY4CDd4jMB7).

*Note that all data entered into this form is solely used for the registration process and will be deleted by us after the event.*

Before the event we will send a document regarding the use of photos and videos taken during the event, which all participants must sign and bring with them.

*Note:*
If you wish to modify your registration you can send a copy of the form to your mail (slider at the end of the registration form). With it you can modify your registration. Or the registration form must be completely filled out another time (only the last submission before the deadline counts). Also late registration of participants, after the deadline, is possible but at a higher fee for the late registered participants!

## RCLL Aachen - 2022 Covid19/Corona Rules

Due to the situation regarding the pandemic, we will be paying attention to the health of all participants at this event. Therefore, access (both participants and spectators) is only possible under the **2G+ rule (vaccinated or recovered both with an additional official negative test or for boostered people a self-test)**. For this you need a proof which is valid in the EU.

Even if many of the Corona rules could be dropped before the event, we currently assume, since we are staying with many people in an indoor area, that we require you to wear a medical mask all the time and do an official Corona test or self-test every day.

Overall we'd like to let participants enjoy the competition instead of worrying about their health.

## RCLL Aachen - 2022 Drinks and food

There are some shops around the premises of WZL Aachen so we currently do not consider organizing any additional catering.

## RCLL Aachen - 2022 RCLL rules

Currently the changes to the rulebook of the RCLL are still a work in progress but we will consider the latest release of the rulebook **available at the beginning of the event - May 2.** to be found under the following link :

https://github.com/robocup-logistics/rcll-rulebook/releases
