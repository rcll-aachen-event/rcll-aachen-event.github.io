At this time we are planning to allow a certain number of public visitors from the 14.04. to the 17.04. live at the location with a [2G+ model](https://www.hamburg.com/residents/settle/health/15811494/covid-access-plans).
As said the COVID-19 situation brings unpredictability, thus regulations might change.
Due to this and the event still being in the planning phase, concrete information will follow and be reflected on this site.
