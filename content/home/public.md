To address the pandemic situation and ensure a safe presence of participants we plan to host live streams of the event instead of opening it to the public.

**However please note the following**:

The room chosen for the event will also be used in parallel by a small number of students that are busy with an ongoing project.
In addition small numbers of external visitors will be present to visit the event.
Nonetheless the same COVID-19 rules as noted below apply to them too.

The total number of persons in the room shall not exceed the mark of 30 persons max.
We will encourage external visitors to take action in case this number exceeds.

We will share the YouTube live stream here once available.
