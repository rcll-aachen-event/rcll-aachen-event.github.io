As feedback from the preparation meeting and to maximize the number of games for each team and given that only a limited number of games can be played in both arenas we are scheduling the games utilizing a modified version of the [Swiss-System Tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament). The aim is that every team plays against opponents of about the same strength and not, as is usually the case, to play out a clear winner.

As bases for the initial placement of the teams, we use the results of the GermanOpen from 2014 till 2019 (only considered the available teams). These scores lead to the first ranking of the teams:

| Team           | 2019 GO | 2018 GO | 2017 GO | 2016 GO | 2015 GO | 2014 GO | Score |
| -------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ----- |
| B-Human        | 1       | 3       | 1       | 1       | 1       | 1       | 8     |
| HTWK Robots    | 2       | 1       | 2       | 2       | 2       | 3       | 12    |
| NaoDevils      | 4       | 2       | 3       | 3       | 3       | 2       | 17    |
| Berlin United  | 4       | 5       | 4       | 4       | 4       | 5       | 26    |
| HULKs          | 3       | 4       | 5       | 5       | 6       | 6       | 29    |
| Bembelbots     | 6       | 6       | 6       | 6       | 5       | 4       | 33    |
| R-ZWEI-KICKERS | 7       | 7       | 7       | 7       | 7       | 7       | 42    |

In total, we are going to play **four** rounds with each three games and one team get a free card.

Each round the first team gets the free card and is scored with 1 point. The other pairings will be 2 vs 3, 4 vs 5 and 6 vs 7. Two points are awarded for the match winner, one point for a tie and zero points otherwise. 

After the initial ranking the following rankings for each round are based on the accumulated points from the matches. For teams with the same score, at the beginning of each round, the direct comparison is used first and otherwise a ranking based on the initial scoring is taken. 

Each team can only get the free card once and there are no duplicate matches. Otherwise the ranking is adapted accordingly to the next best candidate.
