Due to the pandemic the RoboCup German Open 2022 [had to be canceled](https://robocup.de/2021/10/15/call-german-robocup-junior-2022/) once again.
However major leagues have the opportunity to conduct local events as a substitution. Due to the expressed interest by teams in the RoboCup Logistics League the RCLL Aachen event was
created as a per-league alternative to the RC GO 2022.

The event will be held in premises belonging to the [Laboratory for Machine Tools and Production Engineering (WZL) of RWTH Aachen University](https://www.wzl.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/sijq/?lidx=1).
The given room size of 35m * 17m will give enough space to organize a full-scale RCLL including the full playing field and tables etc. for upto 5-6 teams and an eduroam-based
internet access for the teams. The latter would also be available via guest accounts.

Due to the unpredictability, we are preparing for different scenarios ranging from a full physical championship to an online event.
Teams joining remotely will have the opportunity to play with the rules applied at the world-wide RoboCup 2021. The same applies if we can only conduct online events.

The event is planned for the time frame between May 2. till May 6.
