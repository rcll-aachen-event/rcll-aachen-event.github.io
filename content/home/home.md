Since RoboCup 2021 will be held virtually all around the world, owing to the ongoing COVID-19situation and the Standard Platform League is taking on a new format that is designed to provide all teams an opportunity to competitively measure their skills in robot soccer within the current circumstances without any physical presence on a common competition site.

**G**erman **O**pen **R**eplacement **E**vent has been introduced to enable the League for having 5 vs 5 on-site games in local arenas in Central Europe. The team's robots travel, but the human members stay at home.
