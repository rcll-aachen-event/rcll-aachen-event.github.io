The RoboCup German Open 2022 have been conducted in a distributed manner to allow major leagues to conduct local events and compete despite the pandemic. Find an overview on the conducted events [here](https://robocup.de/go2022-en/).

After an exciting setup time the teams were ready for either presence or remote participation during May 2. - May 6. 2022.

We greatly want to thank everyone involved for the great time, the organizational help and a beautiful display of the pleasures of science/engineering all around! Without all of you this event would not have been possible. Thank you!

We specially thank the [Laboratory for Machine Tools and Production Engineering (WZL) of RWTH Aachen University](https://www.wzl.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/sijq/?lidx=1) and the [Mobile Autonomous Systems and Cogntive Robotics Institute](https://maskor.fh-aachen.de/en/) for sponsoring the whole event by providing the required space along with the machines required for a full-scale RoboCup Logistics League experience.
We also thank [Festo Didactic](https://www.festo-didactic.com) for the preparation of the machines and the on-site maintenance of the field.
