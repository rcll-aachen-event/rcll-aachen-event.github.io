The RoboCup German Open 2022 are conducted in a distributed manner to allow major leagues to conduct local events and compete despite the pandemic. Find an overview on the conducted events [here](https://robocup.de/go2022-en/).

Due to the expressed interest by teams in the RoboCup Logistics League the RCLL Aachen 2022 event is created as a per-league local event for the RC GO 2022.

The event will be held in premises belonging to the [Laboratory for Machine Tools and Production Engineering (WZL) of RWTH Aachen University](https://www.wzl.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/sijq/?lidx=1).
The given room size of 35m * 17m will give enough space to organize a full-scale RCLL including the full playing field and tables etc. for upto 5-6 teams and an eduroam-based
internet access for the teams. The latter would also be available via guest accounts.

Due to the unpredictability, we are preparing for different scenarios ranging from a full physical championship to an online event.
Teams joining remotely will have the opportunity to play with the rules applied at the world-wide RoboCup 2021. The same applies if we can only conduct online events.

The event is planned for the time frame between May 2. till May 6.
